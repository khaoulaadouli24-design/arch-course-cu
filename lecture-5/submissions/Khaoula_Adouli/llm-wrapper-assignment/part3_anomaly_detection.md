# Anomaly Detection Design
 
This document describes the anomaly detection strategy used in the LLM API Wrapper system. The goal is to detect abnormal patterns in API usage, performance, and cost.

## 1. Request Rate Spike
 
**Description**  
A sudden increase in the number of API requests within a short time period.
 
**Inputs**
- Request count per minute
- Historical request rate baseline
 
**Detection Approach**
A threshold-based rule is used. If the request rate exceeds a predefined limit (for example 3x the normal rate), the system flags this as an anomaly.
 
**Output**
An alert event is generated and sent to the Alerting System.

## 2. Latency Degradation
 
**Description**  
LLM responses take significantly longer than normal.
 
**Inputs**
- Request latency metrics
- Average latency baseline
 
**Detection Approach**
The system compares the current latency to a baseline average. If latency exceeds the acceptable threshold for a sustained period, an anomaly is detected.
 
**Output**
An alert is sent to notify operators about possible performance degradation.

## 3. Error Rate Spike
 
**Description**  
A sudden increase in failed LLM requests.
 
**Inputs**
- Number of failed requests
- Error percentage over time
 
**Detection Approach**
If the percentage of failed requests exceeds a defined threshold (for example 10% of requests), the system identifies this as an anomaly.
 
**Output**
An alert is generated indicating a potential API outage or integration issue.

## 4. Token or Cost Drift
 
**Description**  
Unexpected increases in token usage or cost per request.
 
**Inputs**
- Token usage per request
- Estimated cost metrics
 
**Detection Approach**
The system monitors token usage and compares it with historical averages. If the cost or token count deviates significantly from the baseline, it triggers an anomaly event.
 
**Output**
An alert is sent to indicate possible misuse, prompt inflation, or abnormal workloads.

## Design Decision
 
The anomaly detection process runs in a **separate Anomaly Detection Service** instead of inside the Proxy Gateway. This design reduces the load on the gateway and allows anomaly detection logic to scale independently.
