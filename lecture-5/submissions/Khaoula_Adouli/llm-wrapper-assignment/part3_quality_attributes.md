# Quality Attributes and Trade-offs
 
This document explains the key quality attributes considered in the architecture of the **LLM API Wrapper system**. The system is designed to provide reliable monitoring, tracking, and anomaly detection for LLM API usage.
 
---
 
## 1. Latency
 
### Why it matters

Applications using LLM APIs require fast responses. The wrapper should not significantly increase response time when forwarding requests.
 
### How the architecture supports it

The **Proxy Gateway** is designed to forward requests directly to the LLM providers (OpenAI or Gemini). Tracking and monitoring operations are handled asynchronously through event emission, reducing blocking operations.
 
### Trade-off

Adding tracking and monitoring introduces additional processing. However, this impact is minimized by using asynchronous event streams.
 
---
 
## 2. Availability
 
### Why it matters

Applications depend on the wrapper to access LLM services. If the wrapper becomes unavailable, applications cannot communicate with the LLM providers.
 
### How the architecture supports it

The architecture separates responsibilities across multiple services such as the **Proxy Gateway**, **Metrics Service**, **Tracking Service**, and **Anomaly Detection Service**. This modular design allows individual components to fail without completely shutting down the system.
 
### Trade-off

Separating services increases system complexity but improves fault isolation and resilience.
 
---
 
## 3. Observability
 
### Why it matters

The main purpose of the wrapper system is to observe and monitor LLM usage. Operators must be able to track requests, detect anomalies, and understand system behavior.
 
### How the architecture supports it

The system records request metadata, latency, tokens, and cost using the **Tracking Service** and **Metrics Service**. These metrics are analyzed by the **Anomaly Detection Service** which can generate alerts when abnormal behavior is detected.
 
### Trade-off

Collecting detailed metrics increases storage requirements and processing overhead, but provides valuable insights into system performance and usage patterns.
 
---
 
## Scalability
 
The architecture supports scalability by separating the core services. For example, the **Proxy Gateway** can scale horizontally to handle increasing request traffic, while the **Metrics Service** and **Anomaly Detection Service** can scale independently to process monitoring data.
