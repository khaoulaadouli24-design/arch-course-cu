# Component Rationale – Proxy Gateway Container
 
This document explains the rationale behind the component decomposition of the **Proxy Gateway Container** in the LLM API Wrapper System.
 
The Proxy Gateway was chosen for decomposition because it is the main entry point of the system and contains the most important request-processing logic. To improve modularity and maintainability, the container was divided into smaller components with clear responsibilities and interfaces.

## 1. Request Validator
 
**Responsibility:**  
The Request Validator checks incoming LLM requests before they are processed further.
 
**Why it exists:**  
Validation logic should be separated from routing and response handling. This improves modularity and makes validation rules easier to update.
 
**Interface:**  
`IRequestValidation`
 
**Benefits:**  
- Ensures invalid requests are rejected early
- Keeps validation concerns isolated
- Supports easier testing of validation logic

## 2. Provider Router
 
**Responsibility:**  
The Provider Router decides which external LLM provider should receive the request (OpenAI or Gemini).
 
**Why it exists:**  
Routing logic is a separate concern from validation and response normalization. This component makes it easier to support multiple LLM providers in the future.
 
**Interface:**  
`IProviderRouting`
 
**Benefits:**  
- Encapsulates provider selection logic
- Supports extensibility for additional providers
- Reduces coupling between validation and API-specific routing

## 3. Response Normalizer
 
**Responsibility:**  
The Response Normalizer transforms raw responses from external LLM providers into a common internal response format.
 
**Why it exists:**  
OpenAI and Gemini may return responses in different formats. Normalization ensures that clients receive a consistent response regardless of provider.
 
**Interface:**  
`IResponseNormalization`
 
**Benefits:**  
- Hides provider-specific differences
- Simplifies downstream processing
- Improves consistency for client applications

## 4. Tracking Emitter
 
**Responsibility:**  
The Tracking Emitter produces tracking events based on request and response metadata.
 
**Why it exists:**  
Tracking and observability should not be mixed with validation or routing. This component ensures that metadata emission is handled in a dedicated and reusable way.
 
**Interface:**  
`ITrackingEventEmitter`
 
**Benefits:**  
- Supports observability without cluttering other components
- Enables integration with the Tracking Service
- Keeps request processing logic clean

## Design Principles Applied
 
### Single Responsibility Principle
Each component has one primary responsibility:
- Request Validator → request validation
- Provider Router → provider routing
- Response Normalizer → response normalization
- Tracking Emitter → tracking event generation
 
### Low Coupling
Each component depends on the minimal necessary information and communicates through clear boundaries.
 
### High Cohesion
Each component groups closely related logic, which makes the system easier to understand and maintain.
 
### Modularity
The decomposition allows components to evolve independently and makes the container easier to test and extend.

## Summary
 
The Proxy Gateway Container was decomposed into four focused components to improve modularity, maintainability, and extensibility. Each component provides a clear interface and follows the Single Responsibility Principle, resulting in a cleaner and more understandable architecture.
