# Part 1 – Component Decomposition
 
## Overview
 
The Task Management System is designed using modular architecture principles. The system is decomposed into independent components, each responsible for a specific concern. This approach improves maintainability, testability, and extensibility.
 
The architecture follows the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)** and **Separation of Concerns**, ensuring that each component performs a clearly defined task.

# System Components
 
The system is divided into the following main components:
 
## 1. TaskManager
 
**Responsibility**
 
The TaskManager acts as the central orchestrator of the system. It coordinates interactions between the other components and exposes high-level operations for managing tasks.
 
**Key operations**
 
- Create tasks
- Update tasks
- Delete tasks
- List tasks
- Export tasks
- Send reminders
 
TaskManager does not implement business logic directly; instead, it delegates responsibilities to specialized components.

## 2. TaskValidator
 
**Responsibility**
 
The TaskValidator is responsible for validating task data before it is stored in the system.
 
Examples of validations include:
 
- Ensuring that the task title is not empty
- Ensuring the title meets minimum length requirements
 
By separating validation logic, the system maintains clear boundaries between validation and storage logic.

## 3. TaskRepository
 
**Responsibility**
 
The TaskRepository component handles the storage and retrieval of tasks.
 
Two implementations are provided:
 
- **InMemoryTaskRepository** – stores tasks in memory
- **FileTaskRepository** – stores tasks in a JSON file
 
This design allows the storage mechanism to be changed without modifying the TaskManager.

## 4. TaskSearch
 
**Responsibility**
 
The TaskSearch component provides filtering and search functionality for tasks.
 
Supported operations include:
 
- Searching tasks by status
- Searching tasks by assignee
 
Separating search logic keeps the repository focused only on data storage.
 
---
 
## 5. TaskExporter
 
**Responsibility**
 
The TaskExporter component is responsible for exporting tasks to external formats.
 
Two exporters are implemented:
 
- **JsonExporter**
- **CsvExporter**
 
This design allows new export formats to be added without modifying the existing system.
 
---
 
## 6. TaskNotifier
 
**Responsibility**
 
The TaskNotifier component is responsible for sending reminders for tasks.
 
In this assignment, reminders are simulated using console output.

# Design Rationale
 
The system is decomposed to ensure that each component has a **single responsibility**.
 
Benefits of this modular design include:
 
- Easier testing of individual components
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Improved maintainability
- Ability to replace components without affecting the entire system
 
This architecture also supports extensibility. For example, new exporters or repositories can be added with minimal impact on existing components.
